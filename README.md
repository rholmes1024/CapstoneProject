If you are viewing this repository as part of an employment application I submitted, thank you for your consideration. This is the Capstone project that I completed with my class during the spring semester of 2020 at Kirkwood Community College in Cedar Rapids as part of my AAS in Software Development. I wanted to avoid making changes to this code as much as possible so that you could get a clear understanding of the outcomes of the program, and my contributions to the code base within the original time frame of the project. 
<br /> <br />
That said, in order to avoid confusion I have added this section to offer some clarifying comments about the structure and nature of this project.
<br /> <br />
My class decided to create an application that would help run a fictional animal shelter with an attached pet supplies retailer named Pet Universe. There are two main front end components: one for employee use in-store that utilizes WPF and one for customers and employees to use through the internet that uses MVC and jQuery. The in-store front end is stored in the folder named "WPFPresentationLayer" and the web front end is stored in "WPFPresentation". This project used n-tier architecture so the presentation layer, which contains both front ends, handles input and output. The data access layer retrieves data from and saves data to long term data storage: in this project, that was a relational database using a SQLExpress server. The logic layer served as an intermediate layer that would detect and handle errors.
